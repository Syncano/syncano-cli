Build Status
============

    :target: https://circleci.com/gh/Syncano/syncano-cli/tree/master

    :target: https://circleci.com/gh/Syncano/syncano-cli/tree/develop

Installation
============

To install Syncano CLI tool::

    pip install syncano-cli

**Usage:**

First you need to login into your Syncano account

::

    syncano login

It will ask you for your email and password. After successfully logging in your Account Key (admin key) 
will be stored in *${HOME}/.syncano* file. You can also override an Account Key later with *--key* option.

You can specify the default instance name that will be used in all consecutive CLI calls::

    syncano login --instance-name patient-resonance-4283

If you want to override this setting for a specific command, use --instance-name eg::

    syncano sync pull --instance-name new-instance-1234

Documentation
=============

You can read detailed documentation `here <docs/README.md>`_.


Syncano sync
============

Pulling your instance classes and scripts
-----------------------------------------

In order to pull your instance configuration, execute

::

    syncano sync pull

This will fetch all Classes and Scripts into the current working directory, and
store configuration in *syncano.yml* file. If you want to pull only selected
classes/scripts you can add *-c/--class* or *-s/--script* option e.g.

::

    syncano sync pull -c Class1 -c Class2 -s script_label_1 -s "script label 2"

The Scripts' source code is stored in the scripts subdirectory. Their names are based on
script labels. Keep in mind that script labels in Syncano are not unique, and
this tool cannot yet handle this kind of situation when pulling a Script from Syncano.

Classes and Scripts configuration is stored in *syncano.yml* file. If this file already 
exists, only classes and scripts stored in this file will be pulled and updated. 
If you want to pull the whole instance you can use *-a/--all* switch flag.

Pushing your changes
--------------------

After you have made changes to *syncano.yml* or any of the script's source code, 
you can push the changes to Syncano using

::

    syncano sync push

It will push only changes newer than the last synchronization time. 
As last synchronization time we use *.sync* file last modification time. 
If *syncano.yml* has changed, it will try to push all data to Syncano. Otherwise, 
it will just push the source code files for scripts that were changed. 
If you want to force push all changes you can use *-a/--all* option.

If you only want to push changes from selected classes/scripts you can provide them
with *-c/--class* or *-s/--script* options like in the pull example above.

Synchronize changes in real-time
--------------------------------

There is an option to synchronize your project in real-time. When you change
syncano.yml or the source code of a script described in *syncano.yml*, your changes
will be automatically pushed to Syncano.

::

    syncano sync watch

This command will push all of your project's configuration to Syncano and will
wait for changes made to project files. When it detects that any file was modified,
it will push those changes to Syncano.


Syncano Parse migration tool
============================

This tool will help you to move your data from Parse to Syncano.

**Usage:**

Currently supports only transferring data. This tool takes the Parse schemas and transforms them to Syncano classes.
The next step is to move all of the data between Parse and Syncano. The last step is rebuilding the relations between
objects.


Configuration
-------------

::

    syncano migrate configure

Will run the configuration that will ask you for the following variables:

* PARSE_MASTER_KEY: the master key of your PARSE account;
* PARSE_APPLICATION_ID: the application ID of the application that you want to transfer;
* SYNCANO_ADMIN_API_KEY: Syncano Account Key;
* SYNCANO_INSTANCE_NAME: the Syncano instance name to which the transfer will be made;

`syncano migrate configure` command will take following parameters:

* -c (--current) which will display the current configuration;
* -f (--force) which allow to override the previously set configuration; 

The configuration will be stored in your home directory in the .syncano file under the P2S section. 
It's used to call the Parse API and Syncano API as well.

Run migration
-------------
 
::

    syncano migrate parse

This command will run the synchronization process between Parse and Syncano. Sit back, relax, and read
the output.

Tips & Troubleshooting
----------------------

1. This tool currently does not support checking if an object is already present in the Syncano instance.
   If the sync is run twice, the data will be duplicated. To avoid this,
   simply remove your instance using Syncano dashboard;

2. The whole process can be quite slow because of the throttling on both sides: Parse and Syncano on free trial accounts (which is the bottom boundary for scripts);

Syncano Hosting
===============

Syncano Hosting is a simple way to host your static files on Syncano servers. 
The CLI supports it in the following way:

This command will list files for currently hosted website::

    syncano hosting list

This command will publish all files inside *<base_dir>* to the default Syncano Hosting instance.
When publishing the whole directory, the structure will be mapped on Syncano.::

    syncano hosting publish <base_dir>

This command will unpublish currently published hosting::

    syncano hosting unpublish


This command will permamently delete the hosting::

    syncano hosting delete

This command will delete the specified file::

    syncano hosting delete hosting/file/path

This command will update single file::

    syncano hosting update hosting/file/path local/file/path

Custom Sockets
==============

This is a list of commands available for Custom Sockets. 
If you want to know more about Custom Sockets, `read the detailed docs here <docs/custom_sockets/docs.md>`_.

To install a Custom Socket from a local file::

    syncano sockets install /path/to/dir

To install a Custom Socket from a URL::

    syncano sockets install https://web.path.to/your.file

List all Custom Sockets::

    syncano sockets list

List all defined endpoints (for all Custom Sockets)::

    syncano sockets list endpoints

Display chosen Custom Socket details::

    syncano sockets details socket_name

Delete a Custom Socket::

    syncano sockets delete socket_name

Create a template from a template stored in Syncano CLI::

    syncano sockets template /path/to/output_dir

Create a template from an existing Custom Socket::

    syncano sockets template /path/to/out --socket socket_name

Run endpoint defined in Custom Socket::s

    syncano sockets run socket_name/endpoint_name

Run endpoint providing POST data::

    syncano sockets run socket_name/my_endpoint_12 POST --data '{"one": 1}'

In all of the above cases you can override the Syncano instance being used::

    --instance-name my_instance_name

Providing the instance name this way will override the default instance name
defined during initial setup (*syncano login --instance-name my_instance*)


Config
======

To display current instance config::

    syncano config

To add variable with name `name` and value `value` to the config::

    syncano config add name value

To modify existing config variable::

    syncano config modify name value

To delete existing config variable::

    syncano config delete name

Running scripts
===============

This command will allow you to execute any script (Script Endpoint) with optional payload and read the output.

**Usage:**

::

    syncano execute <instance_name> <script_endpoint_name> --payload="<payload_in_JSON_format>"
