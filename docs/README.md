## Custom Sockets

Custom Sockets are a powerful Syncano feature, which allows you to create your own API. 
They can be used to provide an integration with other applications (e.g. sending emails with SendGrid) or to define custom behaviour for your endpoints e.g. for password reset.
Sockets are build on the top of other Syncano solution - like Script Endpoints.
