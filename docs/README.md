## Migrations

what can be transferred from Parse to Syncano, and what the limitations are.

## Custom Sockets

Custom Sockets are a powerful Syncano feature, which allows you to create your own API. 
They can be used to provide an integration with other applications (e.g. sending emails with SendGrid) or to define custom behavior for your endpoints e.g. for password reset.
Sockets are built on the top of other Syncano solutions - like Script Endpoints.
